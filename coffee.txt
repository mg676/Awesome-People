Fun fact, a Chemex is the best way to brew coffee!

A Chemex is a pour-over style coffee maker. It's an hourglass-shaped glass 
container with a funnel-shape neck. Chemex makes their own paper filters,
which are a bit thicker than normal coffee filters. It makes a smoother, 
less oily cup of coffee than other methods. Since it's a pour over, it gives 
the brewer more control over the strength of the coffee.

One of my favorite features of the Chemex is that, because the Chemex is made 
of heat-resistant glass, it can go on a stove (on low). So, it's very easy to 
warm up a pot of coffee!

I also enjoy making cold brew in the summer. I usually use a French Press to 
make cold brew in the fridge, and then strain it through a paper filter. With 
cold brew, I usually add ice and oat or cow milk. For hot coffee I enjoy it 
black!
